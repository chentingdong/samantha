# Multi theming with tailwind

- tailwind.config.js - This is where we define customizations.
- tailwind.js - generated by tailwind init
- tailwind.css - theming variables and global css.

- As an example, app/Demo.tsx uses classname (.theme-dark) to scope the which style is used for children component.

Since tailwind theming doesn't change much, and building takes time, we choose to not include it with hot reload.
If developer need to update it without restart UI, you can run following command to regenerate the rsuite files, hot loading will take it from there.

```
yarn build:tailwind
```
