# Bellhop UI

There is the fast way, and the better way.

In development mode, we use ReactSuite as our major CSS framework. It's based on Less css,
compiled into production in /dist/rsuite. This is the quickest way to get design into production, in decent quality.

For production fully customized theming, we use Tailwind + Styled Component. It's compiled into production in /dist/tailwind.
We will gradually build up Bellhop design system along the way, so the T+S approach is highly recommended.
